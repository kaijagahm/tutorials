*Background info on the pipe, magrittr, and dplyr*

You've probably cooked spaghetti before. If you're like some people I know, then maybe spaghetti is the only thing you've ever cooked. 

But have you ever cooked spaghetti using *pipes*? I didn't think so.

To start out, I'm going to give you a box of pasta (`box`) and a pot (`pot`) to cook it in. Go ahead and take a look at your materials to see what you're working with.
